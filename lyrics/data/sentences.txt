they say evrything can be replaced .
yet evry distance is not near .
so i remember evry face .
of evry man who put me here .
i see my light come shining .
from the west unto the east .
any day now any day now .
i shall be released .
they say evry man needs protection .
they say evry man must fall .
yet i swear i see my reflection .
some place so high above this wall .
i see my light come shining .
from the west unto the east .
any day now any day now .
i shall be released .
standing next to me in this lonely crowd .
is a man who swears hes not to blame .
all day long i hear him shout so loud .
crying out that he was framed .
i see my light come shining .
from the west unto the east .
any day now any day now .
i shall be released .
if id be so inclined to climb up beside you .
would you tell me that the time just isnt right .
and if i should ever find the key you hide so well .
will you tell me that i can spend the night .
leavin her smell on my coat .
leavin her taste on my shoulder .
i still fail to understand .
what it is about this woman .
if i could bottle up the chills that you give me .
i would keep them in a jar next to my bed .
and if i should ever draw a picture of a woman .
it is you that would come flowing from my pen .

makin me walk out the door .
and i just fail to understand .

helplessly melting as i stand next to the sun .
and as she burns me i am screaming out for more .
drink every drop of liquid heat that ive become .
pop me open spoon me out on to the floor .
leavin her smell on my coat .
leavin her taste on my shoulder .
i still fail to understand .

leavin her taste on my shoulder .
i still fail to understand .
what it is about this woman yeah .

you moon beams in your eyes .

to hide your wings behind your coat .

and its so hard to see .
and youre so hard to find .

just a speck of dust within the galaxy .
woe is me .
if were not careful turns into reality .
but dont you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow .
yesterday i saw a lion kiss a deer .
turn the page maybe well find a brand new ending .
where were dancing in our tears .
and god tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young .

so i can show you how i .
dream away everyday .
try so hard to disregard .
the rhythm of the rain that drops .
and coincides with the beating of my heart .

with the buring of love hanging over my head .
as i walked into the living room .
sit with you .
discuss whats going on .
is it me .
is it you .
is it something i forgot to do .
oh tell me so that i understand .
i just need some time .
gather all my thoughts .
to make up for the love i just lost .

i woke up this morning with a hurting .
that i would never ever wish upon .

you say im not your type but i can make you sway .
it makes you burn to learn youre not the only one .
id let you be if you put down your blazing gun .
now youve gone somewhere else far away .
i dont know if i will find you .
but you feel my breath on your neck .
cant believe im right behind you .
cause you keep me coming back for more .
and i feel a little better than i did before .
if i never see your face again i dont mind .
cause weve gone much further .
than i thought wed get tonight .
sometimes you move so well its hard not to give in .
im lost i cant tell where you end and i begin .
it makes me burn to learn youre with another man .

i dont feel as if i know you .
you take up all my time .
the days are long and the nights will throw you away .
cause the sun dont shine .
nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day .
nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play .
we live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away .
and its never gonna be the same .
cos the years are falling by like the rain .
and its never gonna be the same .
til the life i knew comes to my house and says .
hello .
there aint no sense in feeling lonely .
they got no faith in you .
but ive got a feeling you still owe me .
so wipe the shit from your shoes .
nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day .
nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play .
we live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away .
and its never gonna be the same .
cos the years are falling by like the rain .

she left before i had the chance to say oh .
the words that will mend .
the things that were broken .
and now its far too late shes gone away .
every night you cry yourself to sleep .
thinking why does this happen to me .
why does every moment have to be so hard .
hard to believe it .
its not over tonight .
just give me one more chance to make it right .
i may not make it through the night .
i wont go home without you .
the taste of her breath ill never get over .
the noises that she made kept me awake ohh .
the weight of the things that remain unspoken .
built up so much it crushed us every day .
every night you cry yourself to sleep .
thinking why does this happen to me .
why does every moment have to be so hard .
hard to believe it .
its not over tonight .

that its me that has all the control .
does it thrill .
does it sting .
when you feel what i bring .
and you wish that you had me to hold .
when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love .
youll understand what i mean when i say .
theres no way were gonna give up .
and like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams .

with the buring of love hanging over my head .
as i walked into the living room .
sit with you .
discuss whats going on .
is it me .
is it you .
is it something i forgot to do .
oh tell me so that i understand .
i just need some time .
gather all my thoughts .
to make up for the love i just lost .
youve been so good to me .
given me everything .
take what you want cause it doesnt belong to me .
i woke up this morning with a hurting .
that i would never ever wish upon .
even my worst enemy .
who is she .
what the hell do you people want .
is it me .
is it you .
is it something i forgot to do .
oh tell me so that i understand .
oh i just need some time .
gather all my thoughts .
to make up for the love i just lost .
youve been so good to me .
given me everything .
take what you want cause it doesnt belong to me anyway .
making love to a picture frame .
one more time tonight .
you can tell by the lines in her smile .
something is not right .
where are you hiding .
shes on the outside .
im on the inside crying .
just another crazy boy hungry for your .
hot love wrap yourself around me like a warm glove .
the emptiness leaves me .
and i feel the never need to go back .
to the way i was the way i was .
ive tried and tried and tried and tried .
but ive no concept of consequence .
and im a master of self defense .
days get longer life gets shorter .
she rips me like no other .
so oh dripping from head to toe .
where are you hiding .
shes on the outside .
im on the inside crying .
hot love wrap yourself around me like a warm glove .
the emptiness leaves me .
and i feel the never need to go back .
to the way i was the way i was .
hot love wrap yourself around me like a warm glove .
the emptiness leaves me .
and i feel the never need to go back .
to the way i was the way i was .
and i cant make the same mistake .
if you lose my love it was yours to take .
break down your door take a little more .
when i need you around .
and im so terrified of leaving its a new low .
try and pick me up again but let go .
see how far i get without you .
desperately need more of your .
hot love wrap yourself around me like a warm glove .
the emptiness leaves me .
and i feel the never need to go back .
to the way i was the way i was .
hot love wrap yourself around me like a warm glove .
the emptiness leaves me .
and i feel the never need to go back .
to the way i was the way i was .
baby i dont wanna spend my life on trial .
for something that i did not do .
and maybe if you stopped and looked around sometime .
i wouldnt pass right by you .
maybe its because you are so insecure .
and maybe your pain dont care .
maybe its the chase that really gets me off .
it falls away and its just not there .
you burn another bridge .
break another heart .
you try again it will only fall apart .
infatuation not seeing the rest of you .
is getting the best of me .
its such a shame that you shot me down .
would have been nice to be around .
im touching your skin .
if its only a fantasy then why is it killing me .
and i guess this must be infatuation .
i want it i want it i want it i want it .
i want it i want it i want it .
i try to put my finger on what burns me up .
it always seems to escape me .
and when you have decided that youve had enough .
just tell me where i need to be .
and now her face is something that i never had .
to ever deal with before .
she left me with the feeling that shed had enough .
and im the one wanting more .
burn another bridge .
break another heart .
you try again it will only fall apart .
infatuation not seeing the rest of you .
is getting the best of me .
its such a shame that you shot me down .
would have been nice to be around .

they seem to stay the same .
they wear different clothes .
but play the same games .
many different ways .
to say the same thing .
searchin for the right words .
the ones that would make you stay .
exchanging the way things were .
for the way that they should be .
yeah .
and choosing these words .
is saying to her .
the things that she never heard .
but always deserved .
i figured out what it is all about .
its you that i could never live without .
youre everything .
the air that i breathe .
stupid not to know it all along .
and everything i ever did was wrong .
sadly its too late for sorry .
oh im not even really sure .
who made this mess .
and who threw what punch .
but i could not care less .
all i know is that im here .
and you are not ohhh .

ive tried and tried .
to let you know .
i love you .
but im letting go .
it may not last .

i just dont know .
if you dont know .
then you cant care .
say youll show up .
but youre not there .
but im waiting .
and you want to .
still afraid that i will desert you .
everyday .
with every worthless word .
we get more far away .
the distance between us .
makes it so hard to stay .
but nothing lasts forever .
but be honest babe .
it hurts but it may be the only way .
a bed thats warm with memories .
can heal us temporarily .
but misbehaving only makes .
the ditch between us so damn deep .
built a wall around my heart .
never let it fall apart .
but strangely i wish secretly .
it would fall down while im asleep .
if you dont know .
then you cant care .
say youll show up .
but youre not there .
but im waiting .
and you want to .
still afraid that i will desert you babe .
everyday .
with every worthless word .
we get more far away .
the distance between us .
makes it so hard to stay .
but nothing lasts forever .
but be honest babe .
it hurts but it may be the only way .
though we have not hit the ground .
doesnt mean were not still falling .
oh i want so bad to pick you up .
but youre still too .
reluctant to accept my help .
what a shame .
i hope you find somewhere to place the blame .
but until then the fact remains .
everyday .
with every worthless word .
we get more far away .
the distance between us .
makes it so hard to stay .
but nothing lasts forever .
but be honest babe .
it hurts but it may be the only way .
everyday .
with every worthless word .
we get more far away .
the distance between us .
makes it so hard to stay .
but nothing lasts forever .
but be honest babe .
it hurts but it may be the only way .
just shoot for the stars if it feels right .
then aim for my heart if you feel like .
and take me away and make it okay i swear ill behave .
you wanted control so we waited .
