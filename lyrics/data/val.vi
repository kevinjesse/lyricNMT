yet evry distance is not near .
so i remember evry face .
of evry man who put me here .
i see my light come shining .
from the west unto the east .
any day now any day now .
i shall be released .
they say evry man needs protection .
they say evry man must fall .
yet i swear i see my reflection .
some place so high above this wall .
i see my light come shining .
from the west unto the east .
any day now any day now .
i shall be released .
standing next to me in this lonely crowd .
is a man who swears hes not to blame .
all day long i hear him shout so loud .
crying out that he was framed .
i see my light come shining .
from the west unto the east .
any day now any day now .
i shall be released .
would you tell me that the time just isnt right .
and if i should ever find the key you hide so well .
will you tell me that i can spend the night .
leavin her smell on my coat .
leavin her taste on my shoulder .
i still fail to understand .
what it is about this woman .
if i could bottle up the chills that you give me .
i would keep them in a jar next to my bed .
and if i should ever draw a picture of a woman .
it is you that would come flowing from my pen .
leavin her clothes on my floor .
makin me walk out the door .
and i just fail to understand .
what it is about this woman .
fail to understand .
what it is about this woman yeah .
ooh .
helplessly melting as i stand next to the sun .
and as she burns me i am screaming out for more .
drink every drop of liquid heat that ive become .
pop me open spoon me out on to the floor .
leavin her smell on my coat .
leavin her taste on my shoulder .
i still fail to understand .
fail to understand .
leavin her smell on my coat .
leavin her taste on my shoulder .
i still fail to understand .
what it is about this woman yeah .

she always belonged to someone else .
i drove for miles and miles .
and wound up at your door .
